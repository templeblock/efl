              When a ampbuf object has "auto mode" enabled, then it will
              enable and disable map mode based on current visibility.
              Mapbuf will track if you show or hide it AND if the object
              is inside the canvas viewport or not when it is moved or
              resized. Note that if you turn automode off, then map mode
              will be in a disabled state at this point. When you turn it
              on for the first time, the current state will be evaluated
              base on current properties of the mapbuf object.

              Auto mode is disabled by default.

              type that has its own smoothing settings, then both the
              smooth settings for this object and the map must be turned off.

              By default smooth maps are enabled.

              precedence. Only image objects have this currently. It stops
              alpha blending of the map area, and is useful if you know the
              object and/or all sub-objects is 100% solid.

              This enables the map that is set or disables it. On enable,
              the object geometry will be saved, and the new geometry will
              change (position and size) to reflect the map geometry set.

              Also, when enabled, alpha and smooth states will be used, so
              if the content isn't solid, alpha should be enabled, for
              example, otherwise a black rectangle will fill the content.

              When disabled, the stored map will be freed and geometry prior
              to enabling the map will be restored.

              It's disabled by default.

           be linearly interpolated between vertex points through the mapbuf.
           Color will multiply the "texture" pixels (like GL_MODULATE in
           OpenGL). The default color of a vertex in a mapbuf is white
           solid (255, 255, 255, 255) which means it will have no effect on
           modifying the texture pixels.
